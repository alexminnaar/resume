\begin{rSection}{Research and Project Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{MSc Thesis}{University College London}{New Methods for Identifying Small Mean-reverting Portfolios}{}
\item Studying the portfolio selection problem of extracting optimally mean-reverting portfolios from multi-
variate time-series datasets while constraining the number of assets in the portfolio. Included comparison of approximation techniques such as greedy search, semi-definite relaxation, and genetic algorithms.
Presents novel on-line learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts portfolio weights to achieve optimal
mean-reversion.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Undergraduate Thesis}{Queen's University}{Stochastic Systems with Data Rate Constraints}{}
\item A dynamical system was studied in which two noisy sensors are connected to a controller through a
noiseless finite capacity channel. A stability result was presented in the case where the eigenvalues of
the system matrix are real and distinct. A policy that achieves stochastic stability is also presented
and is shown to asymptotically achieve the minimum average rate for the communication channel. \\

\begin{rSection}{Invited Talks}

\begin{rSubsection}{Scalable Online Learning of Topic Models with Spark}{4/25/2015}{Text By the Bay NLP Conference}{}
\item This talk deals with the problem of how to learn topic models from large text corpora that are constantly growing such as with online forums. As documents stream into your corpus it is much more efficient to update your already learned topic model rather than batch processing your entire corpus. Apache Spark can be used to perform the sequential updates in a distributed fashion. The talk will also include a discussion on how to use your learned topic model to classify the documents in your corpus based on the topics they contain.\\
